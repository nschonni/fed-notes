## The pitch

Federal Field Notes is a newsletter about digital transformation in the federal Government of Canada (GoC), written from first-hand experience. It catalogues the ups and downs of working to create a more responsive, empathetic, and user-centred public service. [Tune in](#bd-email) for interesting stories, useful observations, and practical advice.

## Why should I listen to you?

Fair question. I‚Äôve worked in government for the better part of a decade now: I was ~3 years at the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) in the UK, and nearly 4 years in Canada, mostly at the [Canadian Digital Service (CDS)](https://digital.canada.ca).

### Open by default

At GDS, I spent the majority of my time working as a Developer on the ({% footnoteref "digital-marketplace" "Canada also has something called the ‚ÄúDigital Marketplace‚Äù (https://technationportal.ca), but the one in the UK is actually useful. " %}UK‚Äôs{% endfootnoteref %}) [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk), but also [the (erstwhile) Performance Platform](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/tag/performance-platform/) (<abbr title="Rest in Peace">RIP</abbr>), and, very briefly, on [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk). As a civil servant for the UK government, I was always on design-led multidisciplinary teams with autonomy over their technical stack and product decisions. We used modern technology, regularly tested upcoming features with users, set up continuous integration for daily releases, and put nearly all of our work on into public Github repositories. In sum, we were following the [the Government of Canada‚Äôs Digital Standards Playbook](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/government-canada-digital-standards.html) pretty faithfully. <span aria-hidden="true">üòâ</span>

Moving back to Canada in 2018, I was surprised to learn how closed-off our government culture is, where many (most?) federal public servants don‚Äôt have an easy way to publicly share the work they do everyday.

### Closed by default

Traditional Canadian government culture is fairly opaque, mostly due to wildly over-calibrated assumptions around risk: eg, that teams communicating openly with the public may cause public embarrassment or leak details of upcoming work that they aren‚Äôt supposed to.

‚ÄúWhat if this ends up in the Globe?‚Äù is a sentiment heard quite a few times, implying that media stories that aren‚Äôt carefully managed are necessarily bad news. Compare this to GDS in the UK, whose early successes resulted in [many](https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2012/jul/25/cabinet-office-transactional-services-data-gds) [positive](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/nov/06/government-services-digital-default-save) [media](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/15/government-digital-service-best-startup-europe-invest) [mentions](https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/sep/08/local-government-digital-service-gds), or COVID Alert, [specifically](https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/08/why-i-installed-the-covid-alert-app) [lauded](https://globalnews.ca/news/7263448/coronavirus-covid-19-tracing-app-canada-how-it-works/) for its [openness](https://sboots.ca/2020/10/30/working-in-the-open-firsts-for-covid-alert/).

A culture of silence is bad for all of us: for public servants who can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt _feel_ they can) easily share the interesting work they do, and for the public, who often distrust what they perceive as a large, inscrutable organization ‚Äî unable to engage with the many motivated and passionate individuals working on their behalf.

### Make things open

The UK‚Äôs highly successful government digital transformation was predicated on [a culture of transparency](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/22/making-things-open-making-things-better/): working in the open, blogging frequently, encouraging public involvement/discussion, and a strong commitment to plain language. (Check out GDS‚Äô ‚Äú[Words to avoid](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#words-to-avoid)‚Äù in their plain-language guide ‚Äî¬†see how many you come across regularly.)

Federal Field Notes continues that all-important tradition of government transparency.

## What‚Äôs the angle?

What I‚Äôm aiming to do here is open up a place to talk about digital government in Canada in a way that‚Äôs [honest](https://sboots.ca/2020/03/03/find-the-truth-tell-the-truth/), insightful, and interesting. Government IT transformation is hard, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be boring.

### The whole story

I find a lot of public discussions about digital transformation in the GoC are couched in a kind of relentless positivity ‚Äî obviously it‚Äôs great to trumpet your wins, but this only tells half of the story.

While there have been many successful modern digital services released in Canada, there are also years-long initiatives that don‚Äôt ever seem to ship, and motivated teams who end up stalled or burnt-out under reams of onerous compliance (~LINK). All to say, there are _plenty_ of lessons being learned across government that would be helpful to share with other culturally-aligned teams.

This site is **not** about criticizing specific individuals or committees, leaking secret/upcoming projects, or for commenting on government policies. Rather, its intent is to highlight on structural tendencies and patterns of behaviour, and to propose possible strategies that may, ultimately, help to improve service delivery for all of us.

My colleague [Sean Boots](https://twitter.com/sboots) has a great blog post [on blogging as a public servant](https://sboots.ca/2020/01/21/principles-for-blogging-as-a-public-servant/), where he effectively sums up the goal as:

> The approach I want to champion is: openly criticizing things that are systemically broken, while still acting with the respect and integrity that public servants are meant to embody.

That is to say, it‚Äôs not about airing dirty laundry, more about pointing out how the washing machine shreds all of our good shirts.
